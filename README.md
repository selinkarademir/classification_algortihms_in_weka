# classification_algortihms_in_weka
The first part in this project is about comparing different classification algorithms and their performances in WEKA while also predicting unknown class labels within dataset. In the second part, Apriori algorithm is discussed and is used for depicting rules about the dataset while making comments about them.
Note that the original arff files (datasets) chosen to be used on this specific project are available in WEKA's data files and can be retrieved from there.
